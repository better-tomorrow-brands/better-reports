# v1.2.1 — Facebook Ads Sync & DB Migration Fix

## Summary

Patch release fixing Facebook Ads data sync and resolving a missing-column error in the production database.

## Changes

### Facebook Ads Sync UI (Settings → Meta)
- Added **Sync Facebook Ads** section in Settings → Meta tab
- Date range pickers (start/end) for selecting the sync window
- **Run Sync** button POSTs to `POST /api/backfill/facebook` with the selected dates
- Result message shows days processed, ads fetched, and rows upserted
- Errors shown in red; success in green (consistent with other backfill sections)

### POST endpoint for Facebook backfill
- Added `POST /api/backfill/facebook` handler using org auth (no CRON_SECRET required)
- Accepts `{ start: "YYYY-MM-DD", end: "YYYY-MM-DD" }` body
- Returns `{ daysProcessed, totalAds, totalInserted }`
- GET handler (cron-triggered) unchanged

### DB Migration — missing columns on production
- Columns `link_clicks`, `shop_clicks`, `landing_page_views`, `cost_per_landing_page_view` were missing from the production Neon database (`DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` endpoint)
- Migration `0020_lame_paibok.sql` had been applied locally but not to the correct prod endpoint
- Columns added directly via ALTER TABLE on both Neon endpoints
- Drizzle migration journal updated accordingly

### UI polish
- Success result text in the **Backfill Campaign IDs** section changed from grey to green, consistent with the Sync section and Shopify backfill UI
